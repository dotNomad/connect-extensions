This R Shiny extension allows Posit Connect content viewers to make a GET 
request to a specified endpoint using their OAuth access token obtained by 
Connect. 

If the request succeeds a message reflecting the same is displayed to the user, 
and the results of the request can be viewed by expanding the "Show results" 
section.

On failure an error message is displayed that includes the HTTP error code. The 
results of the request are logged instead of displayed to the user, as the 
Connect publisher or administrator is likely handling debugging the resource 
request failure.
